[mod-setting-description]
pelagos-allow-fishing=Cargo ships mod disables catching fishes by inserters but this is handy mechanic on planet Pelagos. You can still disable it here if you want.
pelagos-force-small-electric-generator=The Pelagos Force Small Electric Generator mod for cargo ships allows you to turn off the electric generator on an oil rig via the settings. However, Pelagos requires the electric generator on the oil rig in its code. Setting the oil rig's onboard generator to "None" and turning off this setting will cause an error when trying to launch the game.
pelagos-boat-inventory=The default value for boat inventory was too high, so it has been reduced to a smaller value. (default in cargo ships 80)
pelagos-cargoship-inventory=The default value for cargo ship inventory was too high, so it has been reduced to a smaller value. (default in cargo ships 1000)
pelagos-tanker-capacity=The default value for tanker capacity was too high, so it has been reduced to a smaller value. (default in cargo ships 250000)

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
pelagos-briefing-main=[planet=pelagos] is an insular world rich in tropical [entity=coconut-palm], [entity=methane], [entity=iron-ore], and minor lifeforms, including [entity=fish], and [entity=copper-biter-spawner] (which are source of copper here), . Harvest coconuts and process them into oil, sealant, and biofuels, experiment with fermentation, and use high-temperature [entity=calciner] to refine raw materials.
pelagos-coconuts-and-oil=Harvest coconuts from [entity=coconut-palm]. Coconut meat can be processed into [fluid=coconut-oil] or turned into [item=coconut-sealant], which can be used for shipbuilding or as fuel. 
pelagos-calciners=[entity=calciner] allows high-temperature purification and transformation of raw materials into refined minerals. \nThe Calciner consumes any fluid with a "Fuel Value", such as [fluid=crude-oil], [fluid=methane], [fluid=coconut-oil], or [fluid=ethanol] (and more). \nThe higher the fuel value of the fluid, the less is needed to burn and process materials. Use it for coconut husks, wood, fish, or other resources that require intensive processing.
canex-excavator=[entity=canex-excavator] is a specialized machine used for controlled land excavation. \nTo operate it, first craft [item=canex-digable] and place it as ground next to a shoreline. Then place the [entity=canex-excavator] on top of it. The machine digs through the placed surface, leaving behind water. \nIts hull is sealed against leaks, so the excavator itself can safely stand on water tiles before and after completing excavation. \nYou can use modules on excavator. [item=speed-module] allows for faster excavation, and [item=productivity-module] will get you more resources.
wooden-platform=[item=wooden-platform] is a modular surface that allows you to place selected machines and infrastructure on water. Use platforms to expand your factory into lakes, rivers, or oceans, while keeping placement restricted to lightweight, stable structures.\nSupported objects include: \n- [entity=pipe]\n- [entity=barreling-machine]\n- [entity=radar]\n- inserters\n- transport belts\n- logistic/storage chests\n- circuit network machines like combinator,lamp,etc.\n- [entity=gun-turret]\n- [entity=flamethrower-turret]\n- [entity=rocket-turret]\n- [entity=pump] (not diesel one)
electromagnetic_waves=Every electric machine and generator emits invisible electromagnetic waves.\nThese emissions represent radiation and interference produced by electricity usage.\nDifferent surfaces absorb them at different rates – water absorbs almost nothing, while sand slowly neutralizes them.\nSpawners and creatures on Pelagos can detect and react to these emissions: the more powerful your electric network, the more likely they are to be disturbed.\nKeep this in mind when building large power-hungry factories, or consider alternatives like diesel-powered machines if you want to stay safe.
