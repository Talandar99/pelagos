[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
pelagos-briefing-main=[planet=pelagos] is an insular world rich in tropical [entity=coconut-palm], [entity=methane], [entity=iron-ore], [entity=copper-ore], and minor lifeforms, including [entity=fish]. Harvest coconuts and process them into oil, sealant, and biofuels, experiment with fermentation, and use high-temperature [entity=calciner] to refine raw materials.
pelagos-coconuts-and-oil=Harvest coconuts from [entity=coconut-palm]. Coconut meat can be processed into [fluid=coconut-oil] or turned into [item=coconut-sealant], which can be used for shipbuilding or as fuel. 
pelagos-calciners=[entity=calciner] allows high-temperature purification and transformation of raw materials into refined minerals. \nThe Calciner consumes any fluid with a "Fuel Value", such as [fluid=crude-oil], [fluid=methane], [fluid=coconut-oil], or [fluid=ethanol] (and more). \nThe higher the fuel value of the fluid, the less is needed to burn and process materials. Use it for coconut husks, wood, fish, or other resources that require intensive processing.
canex-excavator=[entity=canex-excavator] is a specialized machine used for controlled land excavation. \nTo operate it, first craft [item=canex-digable] and place it as ground next to a shoreline. Then place the [entity=canex-excavator] on top of it. The machine digs through the placed surface, leaving behind water. \nIts hull is sealed against leaks, so the excavator itself can safely stand on water tiles before and after completing excavation.
