        1x solid fuel has 12MJ of energy
        10x light oil = 1 solid fuel so 1 light oil is 1.2MJ
        20x heavy oil = 1 solid fuel so 1 heavy oil is 0.6MJ
    - changed absurd cargo ship storage size and tanker storage volume into something more reasonable. Also reduced storage of boat a little bit. 
    - if corrundum planet mod is installed it's space connections will be updated to not overlap with pelagos sigle connection with gleba
