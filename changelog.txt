Version: 0.6.0
Date: 2025-09-14
  Changes:
    - reworked terrain generator, and added pelagos deep sea 
    - biochamber will now be recycled into vanilla recipe (it was overridden by pelagos recipe before)
    - player can now plant coconut seeds (without agricultural tower)
    - moved pelagos rocket part recipe into regular silo (fixes lack of ability to blueprint rocket silo)
    - reduced galleon cost 120 wood -> 50 wood
    - galleon should now be about 3x faster
    - pelagos battery recipe is now unlocked with science pack
    - added new resource titanium sludge. It can be processed into dust and then into plates
    - rocket part on pelagos now requires titanium plate instead of low density structure
    - decomposition science pack uses titanium dust instead of calcite
    - tanker recipe uses 20 titanium plates instead of 20 electronic circuits
    - cargo ship recipe uses 20 iron gear wheel instead of 20 electronic circuits
    - boat recipe uses 6 iron gear wheel instead of 6 electronic circuits
    - diesel inserter recipe uses burner inserter instead of long handed inserter
    - diesel inserter recipe is now a bit cheaper (5 -> 4 pipe, 6 -> 4 coconut sealant)
    - diesel assembling machine no longer requires assembling-machine-1 in crafting
    - calciner recipe now requires 15 iron plates instead of 5 electronic circuits
    - diesel mining drill now has new recipe that doesn't require electric mining drill
    - reduced hydrogen fuel value from 0.675MJ to 0.4MJ
    - added hard dependency on Long_Range_Delivery_Drones
    - changed technology and recipes related with Long_Range_Delivery_Drones to include them in pelagos tech tree
    - fixed planet icon scale so it works properly with telescopic planet discovery
