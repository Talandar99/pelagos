# Planet Pelagos
![welcome_on_pelagos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Talandar99/pelagos/refs/heads/main/readme_images/welcome_on_pelagos.png)
Welcome to Pelagos. Insular planet rich in tropical coconut palms, methane deposits, and mysterious lifeforms. 
Harvest coconuts, process them into oil, sealant, and biofuels, experiment with fermentation, and use high-temperature calciners 
to improve smelting processes in your factory. 

## Build around THE Cargo Ships mod
[Cargo Ships mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cargo-ships)
- Essential dependency
- I love Cargo ships mod, but I always find it difficult to fit into vanilla game.
- I have tried [dredgeworks](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/dredgeworks)  with [wayward seas](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/wayward-seas) , but they replace vanilla gleba progression which is my favourite planet.  
- So I created a planet-mod designed around using ships as the main transportation option.

## Canal Excavator mod
[Canal Excavator mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/canal-excavator)
- Essential dependency
- You can't find stone patches on Pelagos. But you can mine ground with Canal Excavator.
1. Mine big rock on Pelagos to unlock it.
2. Craft an Excavatable surface
3. Mine it with the excavator to get some stone

## Calciner
![calciner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Talandar99/pelagos/refs/heads/main/readme_images/calciner.png)
- A big fluid-powered furnace. 
- Can and should be used like regular furnace.
- Provides an extra 50% productivity.
- Allows the high-temperature purification and transformation of raw materials into refined minerals.
- Should accept any fluid with "Fuel Value" (vanilla game property). Check fluids like light oil in game wiki

## Diesel Machines
- Fuel-powered machines that run on liquid fuels instead of electricity. 
- Allows off-grid automation but requires constant fuel supply.

## Giving new life to vanilla mechanics
![fishing_inserter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Talandar99/pelagos/refs/heads/main/readme_images/fishing_inserter.png)
Fish are a good starting source of nutrients on Pelagos. They are also essential for progression.
- (vanilla mechanic) Fishing inserters. You can place an inserter near the water to catch fish.Remember to use a negative filter (for fish) on your cargo ship unloading stations.
- (vanilla mechanic) Fish breeding recipe. You can use the fish breeding recipe on Pelagos.

## Integrations with other planets/mods: 
### Arig
- Pelagos Landfill productivity also affects Sandstone foundation
### Maraxis
- Coconut Sealant can be turned into Super Sealant Substance if Maraxis is installed. 
- Recipe enables itself when you research "Project Seadragon" just like regular Super Sealant Substance recipe
### Cerys
- Pelagos Methane overrides Cerys Methane if Cerys is installed. 
- Methane is essential resource on Pelagos and it is almost unused on Cerys (vented into atmosphere). 
- With Pelagos you can now barrel up Methane and ship to other planets.
### Boompuff Agriculture
- Puff Gas can be used as Calciner fuel
### AAI Vechicles:Ironclad
- Ironclad is part of pelagos tech tree if both mods are present
- Adjusted Recipe to make it balanced around other ships
### Wood themed mods
- In addition to coconuts, the coconut palm gives a small amount of wood.
- Calciner allows wood carbonization (turning wood into coal).
- Pelagos research allows wood spoiling in a biochamber (turning wood into spoilage).

## Issues?
